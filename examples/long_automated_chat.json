Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Diclofenac, and Celecoxib are for pain and inflammation. Tramadol is for moderate pain, while Morphine and Oxycodone are for severe pain. Aspirin is also for pain and fever, and at a low dose, it's used as an antiplatelet.\n\nRegarding how quickly they act, that can vary. Generally, oral medications take some time to be absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have specific concerns about the speed of relief, it's best to discuss this with a healthcare professional who can advise based on your individual needs.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these medications or any other drugs?"

It really makes you appreciate modern pharmacies, doesn't it? What's the oldest piece of pharmacy equipment you've ever seen or heard about?"

When a side effect like \"drowsiness\" is listed for a drug, say for Diphenhydramine, what does that *actually* feel like for a person?
